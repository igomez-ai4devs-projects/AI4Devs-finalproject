# CI/CD — Infrastructure (topology, environments, containers, environment variables)

> **Status.** Almost nothing here is built. This document separates what is **decided** (recorded in
> `ARCHITECTURE.md` or a ticket) from what is **undecided** (nobody has chosen it yet). Never present

## Target topology — decided

`ARCHITECTURE.md` §3 (C4 level 2), driven by K8 *"one deployable API and one deployable web client —
a modular monolith, not microservices"*:

| Container | What it is | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `apps/api` | One NestJS 11.2 process | Every route under `/api`, except `/health/live` and `/health/ready` |
| `apps/web` | One Angular 20.3 client, built to static assets | No SSR — `apps/web` has no `main.server.ts` and none is planned |
| PostgreSQL 18 | The single system of record | One database, one schema per bounded context |

Deliberately **absent from the MVP**: no message broker, no cache tier, no separate reporting store.
If a task implies one, it is a scope change, not an infrastructure detail.

## Environments

| Environment | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Local, no containers | **Works today** | `pnpm nx serve api` / `serve web`. This is the daily loop |
| Local Docker stack | **Works today** | `docker/docker-compose.dev.yml` — `postgres:18.6` plus `api`/`web` dev images |
| E2E database | **Works today, still unused** | `docker/docker-compose.e2e.yml` — disposable `postgres:18.6`. `T-C10-06` is closed and its `acceptance` job in `deploy-stage.yml` runs `nx e2e api-e2e`/`web-e2e` for real, but neither step brings up this compose file or any database service — `apps/api` boots for the suite with no database (see `pipeline.md`) |
| Pipeline runner | **Built** | GitHub Actions, `.github/workflows/deploy-stage.yml` — see `pipeline.md` |
| Stage | **Decided and built (ADR-013), not yet deployed** | Render, prebuilt `ghcr.io` images from `docker/docker-compose.stage.yml`; see below |
| Production | **Does not exist and none is planned** | ADR-013, driver K8 (academic/portfolio delivery capacity) |

## The deployment decision — ADR-013

`readme.md` §2.4 ("Infraestructura y despliegue") is answered and [ADR-013](../../../../docs/product/ARCHITECTURE.md)
(`docs/product/ARCHITECTURE.md` §10) records it. Do not re-derive or re-open it — read both before
touching anything platform-related.

| Aspect | Decision |
|---|---|
| Platform | **Render**, one service per deployable, **stage only** — no production |
| Artifact | Prebuilt OCI images (`docker/backend/Dockerfile`, `docker/frontend/Dockerfile`), not a platform-side source build |
| Registry | `ghcr.io`, private. Render pulls with a username + `read:packages` PAT held as a Render registry credential |
| Pipeline | GitHub Actions builds the images from `docker/docker-compose.stage.yml`, pushes to `ghcr.io`, then **calls each Render deploy hook explicitly** — an image-backed service does not redeploy on its own when its tag gets a new push |
| Database | Render managed PostgreSQL, created by hand; its connection variables live on the API service |
| Migrations | Render's **pre-deploy command** — never `docker-entrypoint.sh`, never unconditional |
| IaC | **None.** No `render.yaml`. Services and every environment variable are configured by hand in the Render dashboard |

Still genuinely open, and not this skill's call to make:

- **The compiled data source + migrations artifact the pre-deploy command needs inside the running
  image** — `apps/api/src/data-source.ts` does not exist yet (`T-C10-16`). See the packaging note
  flagged in `docker/backend/Dockerfile` above the `pnpm install --prod` line.
- **Secrets and dashboard configuration.** Nobody has created the GitHub Secrets (`RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_API`,
  `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_WEB`) or the Render registry credential yet — that is a manual, one-time setup
  step for the repository owner, not something this skill or a workflow run can do.

## Environment variables

`apps/api` validates its environment at boot through `apps/api/src/config/env.validation.ts`, and
**every key is mandatory with no in-code default** — a missing or malformed key aborts the boot
naming the offending variable. That is deliberate: a default would let a missing key boot the
process with a plausible-but-wrong value.

Today the validated schema is exactly:

| Variable | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` \| `test` \| `staging` \| `production` | Enum — a typo fails the boot |
| `PORT` | integer 1–65535 | No default anywhere |

Database keys arrive with `T-C10-16`, observability keys with the `NFR` epic's observability slice.

**Rules.**

- `.env.example` is the committed template and must list every key. `.env` is gitignored (`.env`,
  `.env.*`, with `!.env.example`), so **nothing automated may depend on a developer's local `.env`** —
  a job that needs `NODE_ENV` and `PORT` supplies them itself.
- Feature code never reads `process.env`; it goes through `ConfigService` (`CLAUDE.md` §3). The only
  place allowed to touch the raw environment is `apps/api/src/config/`.
- Adding a variable means updating `env.validation.ts`, `.env.example`, and any job that starts the
  API.

## Per-project build targets

Read the real `project.json` rather than trusting this table; it is here to tell you what shape to
expect.

- **`api`** — `build` is an `nx:run-commands` target over `webpack-cli` (not the `@nx/webpack`
  executor), producing `dist/apps/api`. It also carries `prune-lockfile` and
  `copy-workspace-modules` targets, which exist precisely so a container image can install only what
  the API needs.
- **`web`** — `build` is `@angular/build:application` (esbuild), output `dist/apps/web`, with a
  `production` configuration carrying budgets and output hashing. `serve` is
  `@angular/build:dev-server` on Angular's default port 4200 (no port is configured).

Note the pattern: **when the Nx wrapper adds nothing, this workspace drives the tool directly**
through `nx:run-commands`. That is why `api:build` calls webpack directly, and why the e2e targets
call `cypress run` directly (ADR-011).

## Health checks

`/health/live` and `/health/ready` are **reserved but not implemented**. `apps/api/src/main.ts`
declares them in the global-prefix exclusion list so that adding them later is a pure addition and
never a change to the prefix contract, but no controller answers them today — every route returns
`404`.

Until they exist, a container or job that waits on the API must wait on the **port**, not on a
health endpoint. Do not write a health-check probe against a URL that returns `404` and call it
green.
