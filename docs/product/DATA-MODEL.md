## 1. Scope of this model

This document models the **phase-0 and phase-1 contexts that actually persist state** (PRD §14.2, §14.3):

| Context | PostgreSQL schema | Phase | Persists |
|---|---|---|---|
| `identity-access` | `iam` | 0 | Users, roles, permissions, resolver groups, competition-scoped visibility grants |
| `audit` | `audit` | 0 | Append-only activity history for every record type |
| `service-catalog` | `catalog` | 1 | Services, Service Offerings, request forms, eligibility rules, categorization taxonomy |
| `incident` | `incident` | 1 | Incident tickets, work notes, links, escalations, priority matrix, lifecycle configuration |
| `service-request` | `service_request` | 1 | Service Requests, form answers, fulfillment tasks |
| `sla` | `sla` | 1 | SLA policies, support schedules, timer instances, warnings, breaches, escalation rules |
| `knowledge` | `knowledge` | 1 | Knowledge Articles, versions, translations, feedback, ticket links |
| `approval` | `approval` | 1 | Approval workflows, requests, tasks, immutable decisions |
| `notification` | `notification` | 1 | Templates, rules, dispatch records, stakeholder lists |
| `reporting` | `reporting` | 1 | Denormalized read models only — no aggregate, no system of record |

`problem`, `change`, `release` and `asset-config` are **phase 2** (PRD §14.4) and are deliberately **not modelled** here — see §17. The phase-1 schema is nonetheless forward-compatible with them: `incident.incident_link` already carries `problem`, `change`, `release` and `configuration_item` as target record types (FR-INC-10) using opaque identifiers, so introducing those contexts is additive.

Two things this model deliberately does **not** contain, per ADR-006 and PRD §3.3:

- **No competition calendar, no live window, no freeze window.** There is no `competition`, no `event_window` and no `deployment_freeze` table. Competition impact is three columns on the ticket plus a justification.
- **No tenant discriminator.** Single-tenant MVP (constraint K7). Adding one later is a migration plus a repository-level filter confined to `type:infrastructure`.

---

## 2. Persistence entities are not domain aggregates (ADR-005)

**This document describes the relational schema, not the domain model.** The two are separate on purpose:

| | Domain model | Persistence model (this document) |
|---|---|---|
| Lives in | `libs/<context>/domain` — `type:domain` | `libs/<context>/infrastructure/**/persistence/entities` — `type:infrastructure` |
| File suffix | `*.aggregate.ts`, `*.vo.ts`, `*.event.ts` | `*.entity.ts` (the suffix is reserved for ORM artifacts) |
| Shape | `Incident` aggregate root with `Priority`, `CompetitionImpactFlag`, `CompetitionSubject` value objects and behavior | `incident_ticket` row with flat, nullable, indexable columns |
| Knows about | Nothing — pure TypeScript, not even `new Date()` | TypeORM 1.1, `pg`, PostgreSQL types |
| Joined by | — | An explicit `*.mapper.ts`, hand-written, tested |

Consequences that shape every table below:

1. **A table is not an aggregate.** `incident_ticket` plus `incident_work_note`, `incident_attachment`, `incident_assignment_history`, `incident_state_transition` and `incident_link` together persist **one** `Incident` aggregate. The repository loads and saves them as a unit inside a single transaction; nothing outside the `incident` context ever writes them.
2. **Value objects are stored inline as columns, not as tables.** A value object has no identity and no independent lifecycle, so giving it a row and a surrogate key would be a modelling lie. The inlined value objects are:

| Value object | Stored as | Table |
|---|---|---|
| `TicketReference` | `reference varchar(20)` + unique index | `incident_ticket`, `sr_request` |
| `Priority` | `priority`, `priority_overridden`, `priority_override_justification`, `priority_matrix_id` | `incident_ticket` |
| `CompetitionImpactFlag` | `competition_affects`, `competition_justification`, `competition_flag_set_by`, `competition_flag_set_at` | `incident_ticket`, `sr_request` |
| `CompetitionSubject` | `competition_subject_type`, `competition_subject_external_id`, `competition_subject_label` | `incident_ticket`, `sr_request` |
| `OriginChannel` | `origin_channel` (PG enum) | `incident_ticket`, `sr_request` |
| `ResolverAssignment` | `assigned_group_id`, `assigned_user_id`, `assigned_at` (history in `incident_assignment_history`) | `incident_ticket`, `sr_request` |
| `SlaCommitment` | `target_at`, `response_target_at` on `sla_instance` | `sla_instance` |
| `NoteVisibility` | `visibility` (PG enum) | `incident_work_note`, `sr_comment` |
| `DateTimeRange` (temporal validity, UTC instants) | `valid_from` / `valid_to`; open-ended while `valid_to IS NULL` | `iam_competition_scope`, `apr_delegation` |
| `DateTimeRange` (version effective range) | `effective_from` / `effective_to` | `sla_policy` |
| `OpeningWindow` (`sla`-local wall clock — **not** a kernel VO) | `day_of_week` + `start_time` / `end_time` | `sla_schedule_window` |

The last row is where this list deliberately stops at a context boundary. `sla_schedule_window` stores a weekly opening window as a **wall-clock** pair interpreted in the parent schedule's `time_zone` (§3.3), keyed by `(schedule_id, day_of_week, start_time)` — a time of day per day of week, not an interval of instants, and therefore **not** the shared kernel's `DateTimeRange` (ARCHITECTURE §4.2). `OpeningWindow`, and the `HolidayDate` behind `sla_holiday.holiday_date`, are value objects of the **`sla` domain**: one context speaks them, so item 6 of the §12.2 architectural checklist keeps them out of `shared/domain`. Two further pairs *are* intervals of instants and are still **not** `DateTimeRange`: `sla_pause_period` (`paused_at` / `resumed_at`) and `iam_user_role` (`granted_at` / `revoked_at`). Both carry a deliberately **non-strict** check — `ck_sla_pause_order` and `ck_iam_user_role_revocation` tolerate `to = from`, which `FixedClock`-driven tests can legitimately produce — while `DateTimeRange` rejects the empty range, so each stays as two columns on its own aggregate. **The dividing line is the strictness of the check, not the column names:** the `DateTimeRange` rows above are exactly the pairs whose check reads `to IS NULL OR to > from` (`ck_iam_competition_scope_validity`, `ck_apr_delegation_period`, `ck_sla_policy_effective_range`).

3. **The ORM never dictates the domain.** No table below exists because TypeORM makes it convenient; where the relational shape and the aggregate shape diverge (for example `incident_state_transition`, which is a projection of the aggregate's lifecycle, not a domain entity), the mapper absorbs the difference.

---

## 3. Schema conventions

### 3.1 Primary keys

| Rule | Decision |
|---|---|
| Type | `uuid` on every table. No serial/bigint surrogate keys, no natural keys as PK. |
| Generation | **UUID v7** (time-ordered), generated by the **repository port**, not by the database — `nextIdentity()` alongside the existing `nextReference()` on `IncidentRepositoryPort` (ARCHITECTURE §6.2). The aggregate is fully constructed and valid in pure domain code before any I/O happens. |
| Database default | `DEFAULT uuidv7()` (PostgreSQL 18 core function; no extension) is declared as a **safety net for migrations and fixtures only** — the application always supplies the value. The safety net is **v7 as well**, so a row written outside the port cannot silently break the ordering property below. See §3.1.1 for the argument and the rejected alternatives. |
| Why v7 and not v4 | Time-ordered UUIDs keep B-tree index locality on high-insert tables (`audit_entry`, `sla_event`, `ntf_dispatch`), which v4 destroys. |
| Composite keys | Only on pure join tables (`iam_role_permission`, `iam_resolver_group_member`), where the pair *is* the identity. |
| Business keys | Never the PK. `reference`, `code` and `email` are **unique constraints** on a `uuid`-keyed table, so they can be corrected or re-scoped without cascading a key change. |

#### 3.1.1 Why the safety-net default is `uuidv7()` and not `gen_random_uuid()`

Recorded so the question is **closed**, not merely unanswered.

PostgreSQL 18 ships **`uuidv7()` in core** — no extension, the same availability class as `gen_random_uuid()`, which has been core since PostgreSQL 13. The option simply did not exist on PostgreSQL 16, which is the only reason the original safety net was v4. When the server pin moved to 18 the choice became available and had to be made deliberately.

**The default is not decoration; it is the one write path that can violate the rule above.** Every row created through the repository port carries a v7 key by construction. The default is reached only by the writers this document already sanctions — fixtures, seed data, and the hand-written migration steps §19 requires for partitions, `GRANT`/`REVOKE` and constraints TypeORM does not generate. Those are precisely the *bulk-insert* paths where scattered keys hurt most: a backfill into `audit_entry` — append-only, monthly range-partitioned, the highest-insert table in the model (§14.3) — is the worst possible place to write a large batch of randomly-ordered keys, and it is also the most likely place for someone to write raw SQL.

**The failure mode is silent and disproportionately expensive to undo.** A v4 value among v7 values violates no constraint, fails no test and is invisible on inspection: UUIDs are opaque and nobody reads the version nibble. It surfaces only as index bloat and lost insert locality, long after the fact. Correcting it then is not a `DEFAULT` change — primary keys are referenced across contexts as **soft references with no foreign key** (§4), so rewriting one is a hand-written, multi-schema data migration rather than a cascade. Today the change costs a single token in a document with no migration, no entity and no database behind it (§19); after the first table-creating migration ships it costs a data migration. That asymmetry decides the question on its own.

**Alternatives considered and rejected.**

| Option | Rejected because |
|---|---|
| **Keep `gen_random_uuid()`** | It leaves a fallback that contradicts the very rule it exists to back up. "The default is never exercised" is true of the request path and false of fixtures and data migrations — which is exactly what the default was declared for in the row above. A safety net that degrades the property it protects is not a safety net. |
| **Drop the default entirely** (`NOT NULL`, no default) | The purist reading: the database is not a second identity source, so an absent id should fail loudly. Rejected because fixtures and hand-written migrations are legitimate writers here, and removing the default does not remove the need for an id — it relocates the choice into whatever expression each author types, which in practice is `gen_random_uuid()` from muscle memory, now ungoverned. A correct default is a stronger guardrail than no default. |
| **Generate v7 in the database and drop `nextIdentity()`** | Would put identity generation back behind I/O and break the rule that an aggregate is fully constructed and valid in pure domain code before any write (ADR-005, ARCHITECTURE §6.2). Not on the table. |

**Consequences.**

- The schema acquires a hard **PostgreSQL ≥ 18** floor. The server major is already pinned there (CLAUDE.md §2, ARCHITECTURE §3, COMPONENTS §5), but this converts a version *preference* into a version *requirement*, so it is recorded as **ADR-012** in ARCHITECTURE §10 rather than left implicit here. The failure mode is loud and immediate — `function uuidv7() does not exist`, on the first migration, in CI — which is the opposite of the silent v4 trap being removed.
- **No extension is introduced by this change.** `uuidv7()` is a core function, so the "no `CREATE EXTENSION` for identifier generation" property of the base migration chain is preserved exactly as it was.
- **This is not a `ClockPort` violation (ADR-009).** `uuidv7()` derives its embedded timestamp from the server clock, but the value is a *surrogate identifier*: its time component carries no business meaning and is never read as a business fact. `created_at` remains the sole authority for "when", and it is still set by the application through `ClockPort` — never by a database default and never by a trigger (§3.3).
- The identifier continues to expose an approximate creation instant to anyone holding it. That property follows from choosing v7 at all, not from this change, and `created_at` is returned alongside the id in the same payloads.

### 3.2 Reference numbers

`incident_ticket.reference` and `sr_request.reference` are human-readable, unique and **never reused** (FR-INC-02, NFR-DAT-01): `INC0000123`, `SRQ0000045`. Each record type owns a dedicated PostgreSQL `SEQUENCE` (`incident.incident_reference_seq`, `service_request.sr_reference_seq`) read by the repository adapter via `nextval`; sequences do not roll back with a failed transaction, which is exactly the desired "never reused" semantic (gaps are acceptable, reuse is not).

### 3.3 Timestamps and auditing columns

Every table carries:

| Column | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `NOT NULL`, set by the application through `ClockPort` (ADR-009), never `now()` in a trigger |
| `updated_at` | `timestamptz` | `NOT NULL`, refreshed on every write. **Absent** on append-only tables (`audit_entry`, `sla_event`, `apr_decision`, `incident_state_transition`) — the absence of the column is the immutability statement |
| `created_by` | `uuid` | Actor identity, soft reference to `iam.iam_user` |
| `updated_by` | `uuid` | Nullable, soft reference to `iam.iam_user` |
| `version` | `integer` | TypeORM `@VersionColumn` for optimistic locking on aggregate roots only (`incident_ticket`, `sr_request`, `apr_request`, `sla_instance`, `kb_article`) — concurrent triage by two agents must not silently overwrite |

**All instants are `timestamptz` stored in UTC** (ARCHITECTURE §3.2, NFR-I18N-03). The Angular client renders in the user's locale and time zone; the database and the domain only ever see UTC. `date` and `time` are used **only** in `sla_holiday` and `sla_schedule_window`, which are intentionally wall-clock values interpreted in the support schedule's own `time_zone` column — that is the one place where a naive local time is the correct model. Because they are not instants, those columns do **not** map to the shared kernel's `DateTimeRange` value object (§2, ARCHITECTURE §4.2) — they map to `sla`-owned value objects, and no wall-clock type is ever promoted into `shared/domain`.

`created_by` / `updated_by` are **denormalized convenience columns**, not the audit trail. The audit trail is `audit.audit_entry` (§14) and it is the only authority for "who changed what" (FR-AUD-01/02).

### 3.4 Naming

| Element | Convention |
|---|---|
| Schema | One PostgreSQL schema per bounded context, named after the context (`incident`, `service_request`, `sla`, `catalog`, `knowledge`, `iam`, `approval`, `notification`, `audit`, `reporting`) |
| Table | `snake_case`, singular, prefixed with the context's short form (`incident_ticket`, `sr_fulfillment_task`, `kb_article`) so that a table name is unambiguous in logs and in `EXPLAIN` output even without its schema |
| Column | `snake_case`; foreign keys end in `_id`; booleans read as assertions (`is_major`, `competition_affects`, `requires_approval`); instants end in `_at`; durations carry their unit (`response_target_minutes`, `elapsed_paused_seconds`) |
| Constraint | `pk_<table>`, `fk_<table>_<column>`, `uq_<table>_<columns>`, `ix_<table>_<columns>`, `ck_<table>_<rule>` |
| Enum type | `<schema>.<name>_enum` (`incident.origin_channel_enum`) |
| Migration | `apps/api/src/migrations/<timestamp>-<PascalCaseName>.ts` (readme §2.3.3) |

The schema-per-context split is not cosmetic: it makes the boundary rule visible in the database, lets `GRANT`/`REVOKE` be scoped per context (used to enforce audit immutability, §14) and makes a future context extraction a schema dump rather than a table-by-table archaeology.

### 3.5 Enums vs lookup tables

The rule is **who is allowed to change the value set**:

| Mechanism | Used when | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Native PostgreSQL enum type** | The value set is **closed** and can only change with a code change, because the domain branches on it. Adding a value is a migration *and* a domain change, which is the desired friction. | `origin_channel_enum` (portal, agent_logged, email, in_app, phone), `note_visibility_enum` (public, internal), `impact_enum` / `urgency_enum` (1–5), `priority_enum` (P1–P4), `link_type_enum`, `sla_target_type_enum`, `sla_instance_state_enum`, `approval_decision_enum`, `dispatch_state_enum`, `actor_type_enum`, `record_type_enum` |
| **Lookup table** (`id uuid PK`, `code` UK, `active`, `sort_order`, + `*_translation` child) | The value set is **administratively configurable without a release** (NFR-CFG-01) and/or must be **translatable without changing its stable identifier** (NFR-I18N-05) | `catalog_category`, `incident_resolution_code`, `iam_role`, `iam_permission`, `incident_workflow_state`, `ntf_template`, `sla_support_schedule` |

Two consequences stated honestly:

- **PostgreSQL enum values can be added but not removed or reordered** without a rewrite migration. That is accepted for the closed sets above and is precisely why anything an administrator may retire is a lookup table instead.
- **Historical reporting semantics are protected** (NFR-DAT-03) because records store the lookup **id**, never the label. Renaming "Scoring & Results" changes one row in `catalog_category_translation` and zero historical facts.

Workflow state is the interesting case: `incident_ticket.state_id` references `incident_workflow_state` (a lookup), **not** an enum, because FR-WFL-01 requires the lifecycle to be configurable without code. The ticket also stores `state_category` (a native enum: `open`, `pending`, `resolved`, `closed`, `cancelled`) as a denormalized, non-configurable classification, so that queries and reporting never depend on customer configuration.

### 3.6 Deletes, retention and erasure

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Soft delete (`deleted_at`)? | **No.** Not on any table. A `deleted_at` column would create two truths about whether a record exists and is incompatible with an append-only audit trail (K4, FR-AUD-03). |
| How is something "removed" then? | Through **lifecycle state**: `catalog_service_offering.publication_status = 'retired'`, `kb_article.status = 'retired'`, `iam_user.status = 'disabled'`, `iam_user_role.revoked_at IS NOT NULL`, `catalog_category.active = false`. Retired reference data stays joinable by historical records forever. |
| Hard deletes? | Only for **unsent** rows with no historical meaning: `ntf_dispatch` rows in state `queued` that are cancelled, and expired `iam_refresh_token`-class ephemera (not modelled — the MVP is stateless JWT). Never on tickets, approvals, SLA instances or audit. |
| Retention (NFR-DAT-02) | A scheduled archival job moves records older than the configured retention out of the operational tables; `audit_entry` is **range-partitioned by month** so retention is a `DETACH PARTITION`, not a mass `DELETE`. |
| GDPR erasure (NFR-SEC-07, K9) | **Pseudonymization, never deletion.** An erasure request rewrites the PII columns of `iam_user` (`email`, `display_name`, `phone`) to tombstone values and sets `pseudonymized_at`. Every other table references the user by `uuid` only, so the audit trail stays structurally intact and reconstructable while the personal data is gone. Free-text columns that may contain PII (`description`, `body`) are handled by a redaction append entry, never by an in-place edit of history. |

### 3.7 Schema evolution

**Migrations only.** `synchronize` is `false` in every environment, without exception (CLAUDE.md, COMPONENTS.md §5). The schema changes exclusively through TypeORM migrations generated against `apps/api/src/data-source.ts`, reviewed as code, and applied through the documented commands; migrations auto-run only when `NODE_ENV=development` and go through a controlled deploy step everywhere else, because the API scales horizontally and concurrent startup migrations are a corruption hazard (ADR-004).

No business rule ever lives in a trigger, a stored procedure or a check that encodes a policy decision. `CHECK` constraints are used only for **structural invariants that must hold regardless of application version** (a resolved ticket has a resolution code; an SLA target is positive; a competition subject has either an identifier or a label). Everything else lives in TypeScript, in the domain layer, where it is testable without a database.

---

## 4. Referential integrity policy — hard FK vs soft reference

This is the single most consequential decision in the model, so it is stated explicitly.

| Kind | Rule | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| **Hard FK** — a real `FOREIGN KEY` constraint | Used **only between tables in the same schema**, i.e. inside one bounded context, and almost always inside one aggregate | PostgreSQL, `ON DELETE RESTRICT` by default; `ON DELETE CASCADE` only from an aggregate root to a part it exclusively owns (`incident_ticket → incident_work_note`) |
| **Soft reference** — a plain `uuid` column, indexed, no constraint | Used for **every reference that crosses a bounded context**, and for every polymorphic reference | The application layer, at the port boundary, before the write; plus a nightly integrity-check job that reports orphans |

### 4.1 Why cross-context references are not foreign keys

1. **It is the database expression of ADR-003.** `scope:incident` may not import `scope:sla`. If `incident_ticket.sla_instance_id` carried a real FK into `sla.sla_instance`, the two contexts would be coupled in the one place the architecture works hardest to keep them decoupled, and the "extract a context later" property of ADR-004 would be a fiction.
2. **Most of them are polymorphic and therefore cannot be FK-constrained at all.** `sla_instance`, `apr_request`, `ntf_dispatch`, `audit_entry` and `kb_article_link` all point at *a record of some type* via `(record_type, record_id)`. A relational FK cannot express that. Emulating it with one nullable FK column per target type would add a column for every context that ever exists — the classic modelling trap this design refuses.
3. **The reference target may not exist in this database at all.** `competition_subject_external_id` points into SCMS, which is a separate system consumed read-only behind an anti-corruption layer, with free-text fallback (PRD D2, R10). A FK there is impossible by definition.

### 4.2 What this costs, honestly

Referential integrity across contexts is **not** guaranteed by PostgreSQL. A defect in a use case can leave an `sla_instance` pointing at a ticket id that was never committed. Mitigations, in order of effectiveness:

- Nothing is ever hard-deleted (§3.6), so the dominant cause of dangling references — a `DELETE` — does not occur.
- Every cross-context write happens inside the same use case and the same database transaction as the aggregate write, so both commit or neither does.
- A scheduled integrity job (`reporting` context) reports orphaned soft references as an operational metric.
- Acceptance tests assert audit and SLA completeness for the MVP flows (ARCHITECTURE §9).

### 4.3 Reading the diagrams

| Notation | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `A ||--o{ B` **solid** line | Real `FOREIGN KEY` constraint, same schema, same bounded context |
| `A ||..o{ B` **dashed** line | Logical/soft reference: a `uuid` column with an index and **no** database constraint, crossing a context boundary or polymorphic |
| `PK` / `FK` / `UK` | Primary key / foreign key column / participates in a unique constraint |

## 5. Overview — context-level model

Aggregate-root tables only, to show how the contexts relate. Solid = real FK (always inside a context); dashed = soft cross-context reference.

## 6. `identity-access` — schema `iam`

Phase 0 (PRD §14.2). Owns authentication material, the RBAC model, resolver groups and the competition-scoped visibility grants that make FR-IAM-03 and FR-KNW-09 enforceable server-side.

### 6.1 `iam_user`

| Attribute | Type | Null | Unique | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | no | PK | UUID v7 issued by the repository port |
| `external_subject_id` | `varchar(64)` | yes | yes (partial, where not null) | SSO/OIDC subject once FR-IAM-04 is delivered; null in the MVP local-credential mode |
| `email` | `citext` | no | yes | Login identity and notification address; case-insensitive by column type |
| `password_hash` | `varchar(255)` | yes | no | bcrypt hash. Null when the account is federated. **Never** returned by any query the API layer can reach (excluded at the mapper) |
| `display_name` | `varchar(150)` | no | no | Name shown on tickets and audit entries |
| `phone` | `varchar(32)` | yes | no | Optional contact for phone-logged intake; PII, subject to pseudonymization |
| `locale` | `varchar(10)` | no | no | Drives `Accept-Language` defaults and notification language (NFR-I18N-02/04) |
| `time_zone` | `varchar(64)` | no | no | IANA zone, **presentation only** — SLA maths never uses it (NFR-I18N-03) |
| `entitlement_tier` | enum | no | no | Drives catalog eligibility (FR-SRQ-02, FR-CAT-04) |
| `status` | enum | no | no | `active` / `suspended` / `disabled`; no row is ever deleted |
| `last_login_at` | `timestamptz` | yes | no | Adoption metric input (PRD §9.3) |
| `pseudonymized_at` | `timestamptz` | yes | no | Non-null means PII columns hold tombstones (NFR-SEC-07) |

**Constraints and indexes.** `uq_iam_user_email`; `uq_iam_user_external_subject` partial `WHERE external_subject_id IS NOT NULL`; `ck_iam_user_credential` — `password_hash IS NOT NULL OR external_subject_id IS NOT NULL` (an account must be authenticable somehow); `ix_iam_user_status` partial `WHERE status = 'active'`.

### 6.2 `iam_user_role`

Role grants are **temporal rows, not a deleted association** (FR-IAM-05, FR-AUD-05): revocation sets `revoked_at`, so "who could do what on 3 May" remains answerable.

**Constraints.** `uq_iam_user_role_active` — unique `(user_id, role_id)` **partial** `WHERE revoked_at IS NULL`; `ix_iam_user_role_active` on `(user_id)` `WHERE revoked_at IS NULL` (read on every authorization check).

### 6.3 `iam_competition_scope`

The table that makes "an Organizer sees tickets affecting **their** competitions" a server-side predicate rather than a UI filter. It holds **opaque SCMS identifiers with a free-text label fallback** — the same rule as the ticket's competition subject (§8.3). There is no FK, no import and no calendar.

Grants are **append-only and temporal**, like role grants (§6.2): a grant is retired by setting `valid_to` and superseded by inserting a new row, never updated in place and never deleted, so "who could see what on 3 May" stays answerable. **At most one grant per user, subject and `scope_kind` may be live at any instant** — enforced by the partial unique `uq_iam_competition_scope_active` (§20.1). Without it, revoking one of two duplicate rows would leave the visibility intact and the revocation silently ineffective; declared *without* its `WHERE`, it would instead make retire-and-reissue impossible.

### 6.4 What is deliberately absent

No `iam_session` and no `iam_refresh_token` table **in the MVP as currently scoped**. The reason is **scope**, not a claim that server-side session state is unnecessary in general — an earlier wording of this section rested the case on "stateless JWT (ARCHITECTURE §3.2)", which §3.2 does not actually say (see §18 M11).

`FR-IAM-06` — terminate sessions after a configurable inactivity period, and re-authenticate for privileged administrative actions — is priority **Should** and is assigned to **no phase**: PRD §14.2 scopes Phase 0 Identity & Access to `FR-IAM-01/02/03/05`, and the §14.3 MVP table does not list it either. **No requirement in the PRD asks for explicit sign-out, for token revocation, or for a token to stop being accepted before its natural expiry** — `FR-IAM-01` requires authentication, not termination. Nothing in Phase 0 or Phase 1 therefore reads a session record, and the bearer JWT is the whole of the MVP's session state.

**What would overturn this, stated so it need not be re-derived.** `FR-IAM-06` does not say *how* a session terminates, and the two readings differ in cost. Under the weaker reading a client-side idle timer that discards the token satisfies the stated intent — an unattended workstation stops showing the queue — and the timeout stays a token-lifetime concern. Under the stronger reading the server must refuse a token whose session has ended, which is **not implementable without a stored record consulted on every request**. Choosing between them is a **Product Owner decision about security posture**, not a schema decision. If the stronger reading is chosen, or if any requirement for explicit sign-out or token revocation is added to the PRD, this section is wrong and `iam.iam_session` must be declared here **before** it is built.

Introducing refresh-token rotation later is an additive migration confined to this schema.

## 7. `service-catalog` — schema `catalog`

Owns Services, Service Offerings, the dynamic request forms, the eligibility rules — and the **categorization taxonomy** shared by both ticket types.

> **Placement decision (not specified by the PRD).** FR-INC-03 requires a Category → Subcategory → Item taxonomy for Incidents, and FR-SRQ/FR-CAT need categories for browsing offerings; the PRD does not say who owns it. It is placed in `service-catalog` because that is the context whose job is *service reference data*, and because duplicating it in both ticket contexts would break NFR-DAT-03 (one rename, two histories). Ticket contexts reference `category_id` as a **soft** reference. See §18.

### 7.1 `catalog_service_offering`

| Attribute | Type | Null | Unique | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | no | PK | |
| `service_id` | `uuid` | no | no | **Hard FK** to `catalog_service` — same context |
| `code` | `varchar(64)` | no | yes | Stable identifier used by seeds, tests and the six MVP offerings (FR-SRQ-09) |
| `category_id` | `uuid` | yes | no | Hard FK to `catalog_category` — same context |
| `publication_status` | enum | no | no | Only `published` offerings are requestable (FR-CAT-03) |
| `requires_approval` | `boolean` | no | no | Drives FR-SRQ-04 routing |
| `approval_workflow_id` | `uuid` | yes | no | **Soft** ref into `approval` |
| `fulfillment_group_id` | `uuid` | yes | no | **Soft** ref into `iam` |
| `sla_policy_id` | `uuid` | yes | no | **Soft** ref into `sla`; the fulfillment target (FR-SRQ-07) |
| `expected_fulfillment_hours` | `integer` | yes | no | Displayed to the requester (FR-CAT-06) |
| `auto_fulfillment` | `boolean` | no | no | Phase-3 automated fulfillment (FR-SRQ-10); `false` in the MVP |
| `version` | `integer` | no | no | Optimistic lock |

**Constraints.** `ck_offering_approval` — `requires_approval = false OR approval_workflow_id IS NOT NULL`; `ck_offering_published` — `publication_status <> 'published' OR published_at IS NOT NULL`; `ix_offering_published` on `(publication_status, category_id, sort_order)` for catalog browsing.

**Form versioning.** `catalog_form_definition.version_no` is immutable once a `sr_request` has been submitted against it, and the request stores `form_definition_id`. That is how NFR-CFG-02 holds: editing an offering's form creates a **new** version; in-flight requests keep rendering and validating against the one they were created under.

## 8. `incident` — schema `incident`

The core context (C1 + C13). `incident_ticket` is the persistence side of the `Incident` aggregate root; work notes, attachments, assignment history, state transitions and links are parts of the same aggregate and carry **hard FKs with `ON DELETE CASCADE`** — the only cascade in the model, and legitimate because those rows have no meaning without their ticket.

### 8.1 `incident_ticket`

| Attribute | Type | Null | Unique | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | no | PK | UUID v7 from the repository port |
| `reference` | `varchar(20)` | no | yes | `INC` + zero-padded sequence value; immutable, never reused (FR-INC-02, NFR-DAT-01) |
| `short_description` | `varchar(255)` | no | no | Work-list title |
| `description` | `text` | no | no | Full report; may contain requester free text about competition context (FR-INC-01) |
| `origin_channel` | enum | no | no | `portal` and `agent_logged` in the MVP; `email` / `in_app` phase 3 (FR-OMN-01/02) |
| `reporter_user_id` | `uuid` | no | no | **Soft** ref to `iam.iam_user`; anonymous intake is impossible (FR-OMN-04) |
| `logged_by_user_id` | `uuid` | yes | no | Agent who logged on the reporter's behalf (phone/chat) |
| `service_id` | `uuid` | yes | no | **Soft** ref to `catalog.catalog_service`; drives SLA policy resolution |
| `category_id` | `uuid` | yes | no | **Soft** ref to `catalog.catalog_category` (leaf `item` level); required before leaving `New` (FR-INC-03) |
| `workflow_id` / `state_id` | `uuid` | no | no | Hard FKs to the configured lifecycle in force for this ticket (FR-WFL-01, NFR-CFG-02) |
| `state_category` | enum | no | no | Denormalized, non-configurable classification so queries and KPIs never depend on customer configuration |
| `pending_reason` | enum | yes | no | `customer` / `third_party` / `change`; combined with the state's `sla_clock` it drives pause semantics (FR-INC-08) |
| `priority_matrix_id` | `uuid` | no | no | The matrix **version** that produced the priority — in-flight tickets keep it (NFR-CFG-02) |
| `base_impact` | enum | no | no | Agent's impact assessment **before** the competition uplift |
| `assessed_impact` | enum | no | no | `base_impact` raised by `competition_impact_step` when the flag is set (FR-INC-05) |
| `urgency` | enum | no | no | Agent-assessed urgency |
| `priority` | enum | no | no | **Derived** from `(assessed_impact, urgency)` through the matrix; never chosen by a requester (FR-INC-04, R8) |
| `priority_overridden` | `boolean` | no | no | Authorized override marker |
| `priority_override_justification` | `varchar(500)` | yes | no | Mandatory when `priority_overridden` (CHECK) |
| `competition_affects` | `boolean` | no | no | Agent-only flag; the whole of ADR-006 reduces to this column |
| `competition_justification` | `varchar(500)` | yes | no | Mandatory when the flag is true (CHECK) |
| `competition_flag_set_by` / `_at` | `uuid` / `timestamptz` | yes | no | Who set it and when; every change is also an `audit_entry` |
| `competition_subject_type` | enum | yes | no | The **affected subject** — a competition entity is never a ticket (PRD §3.3) |
| `competition_subject_external_id` | `varchar(100)` | yes | no | Opaque SCMS identifier. **No FK into SCMS, ever** — SCMS is a separate system behind an ACL |
| `competition_subject_label` | `varchar(255)` | yes | no | Free-text fallback when the lookup is unavailable (R10) |
| `assigned_group_id` / `assigned_user_id` | `uuid` | yes | no | **Soft** refs into `iam`; full history in `incident_assignment_history` (FR-INC-12) |
| `is_major` + `major_*` | mixed | — | no | Major Incident declaration with declarer, time and justification (FR-MIM-01) |
| `parent_incident_id` | `uuid` | yes | no | Hard FK, self-referencing: child of a Major Incident (FR-MIM-03) |
| `resolution_code_id` | `uuid` | yes | no | Hard FK to the lookup; mandatory to resolve (FR-INC-07) |
| `resolution_notes` | `text` | yes | no | Mandatory to resolve (CHECK) |
| `resolution_article_id` | `uuid` | yes | no | **Soft** ref to `knowledge.kb_article`; feeds knowledge-assisted-resolution KPI (FR-KNW-05) |

| `resolved_at` / `closed_at` | `timestamptz` | yes | no | MTTR inputs |
| `confirmation_due_at` | `timestamptz` | yes | no | Auto-close deadline computed at resolution (FR-INC-09) |
| `first_contact_resolution` | `boolean` | no | no | FCR marker set at resolution (FR-INC-18) |
| `reopen_count` | `smallint` | no | no | Reopen Rate input (PRD §9.1) |
| `csat_score` / `csat_comment` | `smallint` / `varchar(500)` | yes | no | Basic capture only in the MVP |
| `version` | `integer` | no | no | Optimistic lock — concurrent triage must not silently overwrite |

**Check constraints (structural invariants only).**

| Constraint | Rule |
|---|---|
| `ck_incident_resolution` | `state_category NOT IN ('resolved','closed') OR (resolution_code_id IS NOT NULL AND resolution_notes IS NOT NULL)` |
| `ck_incident_competition_flag` | `competition_affects = false OR (competition_justification IS NOT NULL AND competition_flag_set_by IS NOT NULL AND competition_flag_set_at IS NOT NULL)` |
| `ck_incident_priority_override` | `priority_overridden = false OR priority_override_justification IS NOT NULL` |
| `ck_incident_subject` | `competition_subject_type IS NULL OR competition_subject_external_id IS NOT NULL OR competition_subject_label IS NOT NULL` |
| `ck_incident_major` | `is_major = false OR (major_declared_by IS NOT NULL AND major_declared_at IS NOT NULL AND major_justification IS NOT NULL)` |
| `ck_incident_csat` | `csat_score IS NULL OR csat_score BETWEEN 1 AND 5` |

These are structural safety nets. The **rules** are enforced in the domain layer; the constraints exist so that a defect cannot persist a record that contradicts the model, and so a DBA reading the schema can see the invariants.

### 8.2 Why the competition subject has no foreign key

Three columns, no constraint, and that is the deliberate design:

- SCMS is an **external system** consumed read-only through an anti-corruption layer (ARCHITECTURE §2, PRD D2). Its identifiers live in a different database; a FK is physically impossible.
- The MVP accepts **free text** for the affected competition instance (R10). A ticket must be loggable when the SCMS lookup is down — NFR-AVL-03 says intake never fails because an optional subsystem is unavailable.
- Sport ITSM must never become a partial replica of the competition model. Storing `(type, external_id, label)` and nothing else is what keeps "a competition entity is the affected subject, never a ticket" (PRD §3.1) structurally true.

`ix_incident_subject` on `(competition_subject_type, competition_subject_external_id)` supports NFR-AUD-04: "list every Incident that affected this competition in a period".

### 8.3 `incident_work_note` and the visibility boundary

`visibility` is a native enum with exactly two values. NFR-SEC-04 — internal notes never reach a requester through any channel — is enforced in the **application layer** query, not in an Angular `@if`. The column exists so that filter is expressible as a `WHERE`, and `ix_incident_note_public` (partial, `WHERE visibility = 'public'`) makes the requester-facing timeline cheap.

### 8.4 Configuration-as-data tables

`incident_workflow*`, `incident_priority_matrix*`, `incident_routing_rule` and `incident_business_rule` are the persistence of NFR-CFG-01 and FR-WFL-01/02/03. Two properties matter:

1. **They are versioned, never edited in place.** Publishing a new matrix inserts a new `incident_priority_matrix` row with a new `version_no`; existing tickets keep pointing at the old one (NFR-CFG-02).
2. **`jsonb` is used only for the rule DSL** (`condition`, `actions`, `guard`, `validation`, `options`). Everything a query filters on is a real column. `jsonb` here is a payload the domain interprets, not a way of avoiding modelling.

---

## 9. `service-request` — schema `service_request`

Structurally a sibling of `incident`: same reference/state/competition-subject shape, different lifecycle (FR-SRQ-05), plus form answers and fulfillment tasks. It carries its own workflow tables (mirroring §8, abbreviated in the diagram) because each context owns its lifecycle — a shared workflow engine was explicitly rejected as a god context (ARCHITECTURE §4.1).

### 9.1 `sr_request`

| Attribute | Type | Null | Unique | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `reference` | `varchar(20)` | no | yes | `SRQ` + sequence; conversion between record types (FR-INC-14, phase 3) preserves the original reference |
| `offering_id` | `uuid` | no | no | **Soft** ref to `catalog.catalog_service_offering`. A Request exists only for a published offering (FR-SRQ-01, K6) |
| `form_definition_id` | `uuid` | no | no | **Soft** ref; pins the form version answered, so later catalog edits cannot invalidate an in-flight request (NFR-CFG-02) |
| `state_category` | enum | no | no | `new → approval_pending → approved / rejected → in_fulfillment → fulfilled → closed`, plus `cancelled` (FR-SRQ-05) |
| `approval_request_id` | `uuid` | yes | no | **Soft** ref to `approval.apr_request`; fulfillment cannot start before a decision exists (FR-SRQ-04) |
| `rejection_reason` | `varchar(500)` | yes | no | Mandatory when rejected (FR-SRQ-11, CHECK) |
| `competition_*` | mixed | yes | no | Same three-column subject pattern as the Incident, same no-FK rule |

**Constraints.** `ck_sr_rejection` — `state_category <> 'rejected' OR rejection_reason IS NOT NULL`; `ck_sr_fulfillment_gate` — `state_category NOT IN ('in_fulfillment','fulfilled') OR approval_outcome IN ('approved','not_required')`; `ck_sr_cancel` — cancellation requires `cancelled_at` (FR-SRQ-08).

### 9.2 `sr_fulfillment_task`

| Attribute | Type | Null | Unique | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `request_id` | `uuid` | no | no | **Hard FK**, `ON DELETE CASCADE` — a task has no life outside its request |
| `sequence_no` | `integer` | no | with request | Ordering for sequential tasks |
| `execution_mode` | enum | no | no | `sequential` or `parallel` (FR-SRQ-06) |
| `is_mandatory` | `boolean` | no | no | The parent may close only when every mandatory task is `completed` or `skipped` |
| `state` | enum | no | no | `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `skipped`, `failed` |

**Constraints.** `uq_sr_task_sequence` on `(request_id, sequence_no)`; `ix_sr_task_open` on `(assigned_group_id, state)` partial `WHERE state IN ('pending','in_progress')` for the fulfiller work list.

### 9.3 Form answers: rows, not a blob

`sr_field_value` stores one row per answered field rather than a single `jsonb` document on the request. The reason is reporting and search: FR-RPT-05 requires filtering, and support needs to answer "every organizer-access request for competition X". A `jsonb` document would make that a functional-index exercise on data whose shape changes per offering. `value_json` is retained only for genuinely multi-valued answers.

## 10. `sla` — schema `sla`

The most timing-sensitive schema in the system: NFR-AVL-05 (timers survive restarts), NFR-PRF-04 (warning within one minute of the threshold) and FR-SLA-04 (recalculation from the **original** creation time, preserving previous targets) all land here.

### 10.1 `sla_policy`

| Attribute | Type | Null | Unique | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `record_type` | enum | no | in UK | `incident` or `service_request` — Incident and fulfillment targets are distinct policies (FR-SRQ-07) |
| `service_id` / `offering_id` | `uuid` | yes | in UK | **Soft** refs; `NULL` means "any", which is how a default policy is expressed |
| `priority` | enum | yes | in UK | `NULL` means "any priority" |
| `specificity` | `integer` | no | no | Precomputed rank (offering > service > default, priority-specific > any) so that "attach exactly one applicable policy" (FR-SLA-02) is a deterministic `ORDER BY specificity DESC LIMIT 1`, not an implicit rule |
| `response_target_minutes` / `resolution_target_minutes` | `integer` | no | no | Minutes of **schedule time**, not wall time |
| `effective_from` / `effective_to` | `timestamptz` | — | no | Policies are versioned, never edited in place |

**Constraints.** `uq_sla_policy_scope` — `UNIQUE NULLS NOT DISTINCT (record_type, service_id, offering_id, priority, major_incident_only, version_no)`. The `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` is **load-bearing, not a detail of the full dictionary** (§20.5): `service_id`, `offering_id` and `priority` use `NULL` to mean "any" — a real value here, not an unknown — so under PostgreSQL's default the constraint would permit unlimited duplicate *default* policies and enforce nothing where resolution is most ambiguous (FR-SLA-01/02). Also `ck_sla_targets_positive` — both targets `> 0`; `ck_sla_target_order` — `response_target_minutes <= resolution_target_minutes`.

### 10.2 `sla_instance`

| Attribute | Type | Null | Unique | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `record_type` + `record_id` | enum + `uuid` | no | in UK | Polymorphic **soft** reference to the ticket. No FK: `sla` must not depend on `incident` (ADR-003) |
| `record_created_at` | `timestamptz` | no | no | The **original** ticket creation instant. FR-SLA-04 recalculates from here, not from the moment the priority changed — this column is why that is possible after a restart |
| `started_at` / `target_at` | `timestamptz` | no | no | UTC. `target_at` already accounts for the support schedule and holidays |
| `paused_at` | `timestamptz` | yes | no | Non-null exactly while the clock is stopped (FR-INC-08, FR-SLA-08) |
| `elapsed_paused_seconds` | `integer` | no | no | Accumulated pause, so remaining time is derivable from stored timestamps alone — never from an in-memory counter (NFR-AVL-05, ADR-009) |
| `state` | enum | no | no | `running`, `paused`, `met`, `breached`, `cancelled`, `superseded` |
| `breached` / `breached_at` / `breach_elapsed_seconds` | mixed | — | no | Written once. **No update path exists** on the repository port, which is how FR-SLA-06 ("no retroactive silent modification") is structural rather than procedural |
| `superseded_at` | `timestamptz` | yes | no | A recalculation supersedes rather than mutates, so the previous commitment stays readable |

**Constraints and indexes.**

- `uq_sla_instance_active` — unique `(record_type, record_id, target_type)` **partial** `WHERE superseded_at IS NULL` — exactly one live commitment per target per ticket (FR-SLA-02).
- `ix_sla_sweep` on `(target_at)` **partial** `WHERE state = 'running'` — this is the index the scheduled sweep job scans every minute; it keeps NFR-PRF-04 achievable regardless of total ticket volume.
- `ix_sla_instance_record` on `(record_type, record_id)` — the ticket view reads remaining time (FR-SLA-10).

### 10.3 Why breaches and revisions are separate append-only tables

`sla_instance_revision` and `sla_event` have `occurred_at` and **no `updated_at`**. Together with `audit_entry` they satisfy NFR-AUD-03 (breach records tamper-evident) and FR-SLA-04 (previous target values preserved). The revision row is the *business* record of a recalculation; the audit entry is the *cross-cutting* journal of it. Both exist deliberately: reporting reads revisions, compliance reads audit.

## 11. `knowledge` — schema `knowledge`

Article identity is stable; content is versioned and translated. Full-text search (FR-KNW-04) is native PostgreSQL — no external search engine in the MVP (ARCHITECTURE §11.3, constraint K8).

### 11.1 `kb_article`

| Attribute | Type | Null | Unique | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `reference` | `varchar(20)` | no | yes | Stable citable identifier (`KB0000031`) |
| `article_type` | enum | no | no | FR-KNW-01 |
| `status` | enum | no | no | `draft → review → published → retired`; publication requires an approver (FR-KNW-02) |
| `visibility` | enum | no | no | `requester` or `internal`. **There is no `public` value** — no article is reachable without authentication (FR-KNW-03, FR-IAM-01) |
| `current_version_no` | `integer` | no | no | Points at the version served to readers |
| `review_due_at` | `timestamptz` | yes | no | Drives the stale-article review queue (FR-KNW-07) |
| `helpful_count` / `not_helpful_count` | `integer` | no | no | Denormalized counters maintained from `kb_article_feedback` |

**Constraints.** `ck_kb_published` — `status <> 'published' OR (published_at IS NOT NULL AND approved_by IS NOT NULL)`; `uq_kb_feedback` on `(article_id, user_id)` — one rating per reader.

### 11.2 Full-text search

`kb_article_translation.search_vector` is a **generated stored column**:

`to_tsvector(<locale regconfig>, coalesce(title,'') || ' ' || coalesce(summary,'') || ' ' || coalesce(body_markdown,''))`

with `ix_kb_search` as a **GIN** index on it, plus a `pg_trgm` GIN index on `title` for typo-tolerant intake suggestions (FR-INC-16). Search always runs against the current version of `published` articles and is **filtered server-side by the reader's visibility entitlement** — the filter is a `WHERE` clause in the repository, never a client-side omission (NFR-SEC-02). Language configuration is selected per row from `locale`, which is why translations are rows rather than columns.

## 12. `approval` — schema `approval`

One generic engine serving Service Requests now and Changes/Releases in phase 2 (FR-APR-01/02). The decision row is the most tightly locked table in the model after `audit_entry`.

### 12.1 `apr_decision` — immutability by construction

| Attribute | Type | Null | Unique | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `task_id` | `uuid` | no | **yes** | One decision per approval task. The unique constraint is what makes "a decision cannot be re-taken" a database fact (FR-APR-07) |
| `decision` | enum | no | no | `approved` / `rejected` only |
| `comment` | `varchar(1000)` | yes | no | Mandatory on rejection (`ck_apr_decision_comment`) |
| `decided_by` | `uuid` | no | no | The actor who actually decided |
| `on_behalf_of` | `uuid` | yes | no | The original approver when the decision came from a delegate (FR-APR-04) |
| `decided_at` | `timestamptz` | no | no | Append-only; there is no `updated_at` |

Immutability is enforced on **three** levels, not one: the table has no `updated_at`; the `ApprovalRepositoryPort` exposes no update or delete method for decisions (capability absence, the same technique as `audit`); and the application database role is granted `INSERT, SELECT` only on `approval.apr_decision`. A defect cannot silently rewrite an authorization record.

### 12.2 Fulfillment gate

`sr_request.approval_outcome` is a denormalized projection of `apr_request.state`, updated by the composition-root adapter after the approval context commits. The **gate** — no fulfillment before a recorded decision (FR-SRQ-04) — is a domain rule in `service-request`, backed by `ck_sr_fulfillment_gate` (§9.1) as a structural net.

---

## 13. `notification` — schema `notification`

Every dispatch is recorded against its source record (FR-NOT-08), and dispatch happens **after commit** off the domain-event bus (ADR-008), so a failing gateway can never roll back a ticket (NFR-AVL-03).

### 13.1 `ntf_dispatch`

| Attribute | Type | Null | Unique | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `record_type` + `record_id` | enum + `uuid` | no | no | **Soft** polymorphic ref to the source record — every notification is recorded against it (FR-NOT-08) |
| `rendered_subject` / `rendered_body` | text | no | no | The exact content sent. Kept because "the requester was told X at time T" is evidence, and re-rendering from a later template version would falsify it |
| `state` | enum | no | no | `queued → sent / failed`, plus `read` for in-app and `cancelled` |
| `attempt_count` / `failure_reason` | mixed | — | no | Retry bookkeeping for the in-process dispatcher |
| `correlation_event_id` | `uuid` | yes | no | The domain event that produced the dispatch — makes the event → notification → audit chain traceable end to end |

**Indexes.** `ix_ntf_outbox` on `(queued_at)` partial `WHERE state = 'queued'` — the send loop; `ix_ntf_inbox` on `(recipient_user_id, state, queued_at DESC)` partial `WHERE channel = 'in_app'` — the in-app notification bell; `ix_ntf_record` on `(record_type, record_id)` — the ticket's communication history.

**Never stored here.** Credentials, tokens or secrets in any form (NFR-SEC-05), and never the body of an internal work note to a requester recipient — the audience resolution happens before rendering.

---

## 14. `audit` — schema `audit`

One table. It is the most important one in the system for compliance (FR-AUD-01→06, NFR-AUD-01/02/03, constraint K4), and its design is deliberately boring: a single, wide, append-only, partitioned journal.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    AUDIT_ENTRY {
        uuid id PK
        timestamptz occurred_at PK "partition key - monthly range partitions"
        uuid event_id UK "idempotency key of the domain event"
        varchar_32 context "incident, service_request, sla, approval, iam, catalog, knowledge, notification"
        record_type_enum record_type
        uuid record_id "soft ref - polymorphic, indexed"
        varchar_20 record_reference "denormalized so history stays readable forever"
        actor_type_enum actor_type "user, system_rule, integration"
        uuid actor_user_id "soft ref to iam.iam_user - id only, never PII"
        varchar_100 actor_rule_code "which automation rule fired - FR-WFL-06"
        varchar_64 action "state_changed, field_changed, assigned, commented, approved, notified, rule_executed"
        varchar_64 field_name "null for whole record actions"

        uuid correlation_id "request or job correlation id from pino"
        inet ip_address "nullable"
        varchar_255 user_agent "nullable"
    }
```

### 14.1 `audit_entry`

| Attribute | Type | Null | Unique | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | no | PK part | UUID v7 — time-ordered, so inserts stay at the right edge of the index |
| `occurred_at` | `timestamptz` | no | PK part | The instant of the action, from `ClockPort`. Also the **range partition key** |
| `event_id` | `uuid` | no | yes | The domain event identifier. Unique, so a retried dispatch cannot double-write history — idempotency, not deduplication after the fact |
| `context` | `varchar(32)` | no | no | Which bounded context produced the entry |
| `record_type` + `record_id` | enum + `uuid` | no | no | **Soft** polymorphic ref. No FK is possible, and none is wanted: audit must outlive any record and must not depend on any context |
| `record_reference` | `varchar(20)` | yes | no | Denormalized `INC…` / `SRQ…`, so a 2-year-old entry is readable without a join |
| `actor_type` | enum | no | no | `user`, `system_rule` or `integration` — FR-AUD-02 requires the actor even when it is a rule |
| `actor_user_id` | `uuid` | yes | no | Identifier only. **No name, no email** — that is what makes GDPR pseudonymization (§3.6) possible without destroying history (NFR-SEC-07) |
| `actor_rule_code` | `varchar(100)` | yes | no | Which automation rule fired, with what effect (FR-WFL-06) |
| `action` | `varchar(64)` | no | no | Stable action code |
| `field_name` / `previous_value` / `new_value` | mixed | yes | no | `jsonb` so any field type is representable with one column pair (FR-AUD-02) |
| `visibility` | enum | no | no | Separates requester-visible history from internal entries in the same journal (FR-AUD-04, NFR-SEC-04) |
| `correlation_id` | `uuid` | yes | no | Ties the entry to the `nestjs-pino` request log |

### 14.2 What is absent, and why that is the point

**No `updated_at`. No `deleted_at`. No update or delete method on `AuditRepositoryPort`. No `UPDATE`/`DELETE` grant** for the application role on `audit.audit_entry`:

```sql
GRANT INSERT, SELECT ON audit.audit_entry TO sport_itsm_app;
REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE ON audit.audit_entry FROM sport_itsm_app;
```

FR-AUD-03 says no role — including System Administrator — may edit or delete history. That is not a policy anyone can forget to apply: the capability does not exist at the port, and the privilege does not exist at the database. Corrections are made by inserting a new entry, never by mutating one (NFR-AUD-02).

### 14.3 Partitioning, retention and indexes

- `PARTITION BY RANGE (occurred_at)`, one partition per month, created ahead of time by a migration-generated maintenance routine. Retention (NFR-DAT-02, FR-AUD-06) is `DETACH PARTITION` + archive, not a mass `DELETE` that would bloat the table and violate the spirit of append-only.
- `ix_audit_record` on `(record_type, record_id, occurred_at DESC)` — the "activity history of this ticket" query, the single most frequent read.
- `ix_audit_actor` on `(actor_user_id, occurred_at DESC)` — "what did this user do".
- `ix_audit_context_action` on `(context, action, occurred_at DESC)` — configuration-change review (FR-AUD-05) and compliance extracts.

Administrative configuration changes (catalog, SLA policy, workflow, role assignment — FR-AUD-05) are **the same table** with `record_type = 'configuration'`. One journal, one query path, one immutability guarantee.

## 15. `reporting` read models — schema `reporting`

`reporting` owns **projections only**. It is never a system of record, and it never joins into another context's tables at will (ARCHITECTURE §4.3): projections are written from domain events and, for aggregates, refreshed by a scheduled job. That is what makes FR-RPT-07 (same filters, same period, same numbers) achievable.

### 15.1 `rpt_ticket_fact`

| Attribute | Type | Null | Unique | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | no | PK | **The same id as the source ticket** — the projection is a 1:1 mirror, so a rebuild is an idempotent upsert |
| `category_path` | `varchar(255)` | yes | no | Denormalized at projection time so that renaming a category later cannot retroactively change a historical report (NFR-DAT-03) |
| `mtta_minutes` / `mttr_minutes` | `integer` | yes | no | Computed **net of clock-stopping pending states** (PRD §9.1 definition), from `sla_instance` and `sla_pause_period` |
| `response_met` / `resolution_met` | `boolean` | yes | no | SLA Compliance Rate inputs |
| `knowledge_assisted` | `boolean` | no | no | True when a `kb_article_link` of type `resolution_source` exists (FR-KNW-05) |
| `projected_at` | `timestamptz` | no | no | Rebuild watermark |

The union of both ticket types in a single fact table is deliberate: every management KPI in FR-RPT-02 is asked across "tickets", and a union view over two tables would be re-derived on every query.

### 15.2 Reproducibility

`rpt_projection_run` records the watermark, row count, duration and outcome of every projection pass. A reported figure is therefore attributable to a specific projection run — which is the operational meaning of FR-RPT-07. Dashboards read `reporting` only; they never query `incident` or `sla` directly, so a heavy report cannot degrade ticket intake (NFR-PRF-02, NFR-AVL-03).

| `ix_offering_published` | `catalog_service_offering` | `(publication_status, category_id, sort_order)` | FR-CAT-03/05 catalog browsing |

Two deliberate omissions: **no index is created speculatively**, and `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` evidence for each of the above is a scaffolding task, not a claim this document is entitled to make.

## 17. Phase 2 — outline only, not modelled

`problem`, `change`, `release` and `asset-config` are phase 2 (PRD §14.4) and are **not scaffolded, not migrated and not modelled** here. The PRD specifies their behavior (FR-PRB, FR-CHG, FR-REL, FR-CMD) but the schema is left to the phase-2 design so that it is shaped by real phase-1 experience rather than speculation. The intended table families, for orientation only:

| Context | Expected tables (indicative, non-binding) |
|---|---|
| `problem` | `prb_problem`, `prb_rca` (symptom, investigation, root cause, corrective/preventive action), `prb_known_error`, `prb_link` |
| `change` | `chg_change`, `chg_risk_assessment`, `chg_affected_ci`, `chg_schedule_entry`, `chg_pir` (post-implementation review), `chg_standard_template` |
| `release` | `rel_release`, `rel_change_link`, `rel_deployment` (per environment, who/when/outcome), `rel_rollback`, `rel_verification` |
| `asset-config` | `cmdb_ci`, `cmdb_ci_relationship` (typed and directed), `cmdb_ci_version_history` |

**What phase 1 already guarantees for them.** `incident.incident_link` and `service_request.sr_link` carry `problem`, `change`, `release` and `configuration_item` in `record_type_enum` today, holding opaque `uuid`s with no FK. `approval.apr_workflow.record_type` already accepts `change` and `release`. Adding the phase-2 schemas is therefore **additive**: new schemas, new tables, and enum values that already exist. No phase-1 table is restructured.

---

## 18. Modelling decisions taken in the absence of a PRD statement

Recorded honestly, because a reader should know which parts are traceable and which are the architect's judgment. Each of these is a candidate ADR when scaffolding starts.

| # | Decision | Why | Reversibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | **One PostgreSQL schema per bounded context** | Makes the boundary visible in the database, enables per-context `GRANT`/`REVOKE` (used for audit and approval immutability), and turns a future context extraction into a schema dump | High — a rename migration |
| M2 | **UUID v7 generated by the repository port, not the database** | Aggregates must be fully constructed in pure domain code before I/O (ADR-005, §6.2); v7 keeps index locality on append-heavy tables. The database safety-net default is v7 as well, so the fallback cannot break that property (§3.1.1, ADR-012) | Medium — changing the generator is a code change, existing keys stay valid |
| M3 | **The categorization taxonomy lives in `service-catalog`** | The PRD requires it (FR-INC-03, FR-CAT-01) but assigns no owner. `service-catalog` is the service-reference-data context; duplicating it per ticket context would break NFR-DAT-03 | Medium — moving it later is a schema move plus soft-reference updates |
| M4 | **`base_impact` and `assessed_impact` are two columns** | FR-INC-05 says the flag *raises* assessed Impact by a configurable amount. Storing only the result would make the agent's original assessment unrecoverable and the calibration KPI (R8) unmeasurable | High — additive |
| M5 | **`incident_state_transition` exists even though `audit_entry` records the same facts** | Reporting needs per-state durations (MTTA/MTTR net of pauses) as a first-class, indexable in-context read; querying `jsonb` in a partitioned cross-context journal for every KPI is the wrong access path | High — droppable if reporting proves it unnecessary |
| M6 | **SLA recalculation supersedes rather than mutates (`superseded_at` + `sla_instance_revision`)** | FR-SLA-04 requires previous target values preserved; an in-place `UPDATE` would destroy them | High — additive |
| M7 | **`sla_policy.specificity` is a stored precomputed rank** | FR-SLA-02 requires *exactly one* applicable policy; an implicit resolution order encoded only in code is untestable at the data level and unexplainable to a Service Manager | High |
| M8 | **Form answers are rows (`sr_field_value`), not a `jsonb` document** | FR-RPT-05 filtering and operational search across offering-specific fields | Medium |
| M9 | **`audit_entry` is range-partitioned monthly** | NFR-DAT-02 retention must not be a mass `DELETE` against an append-only table | Medium — repartitioning is an offline migration |
| M10 | **A single `rpt_ticket_fact` for both Incidents and Service Requests** | Every management KPI in FR-RPT-02 is asked across "tickets"; a union view would be re-derived on every query | High — projections are rebuildable by definition |
| M11 | **No `iam_session` / refresh-token table** | **Scope, not statelessness.** `FR-IAM-06` is a **Should** assigned to no phase (PRD §14.2 scopes Phase 0 to `FR-IAM-01/02/03/05`) and no PRD requirement asks for sign-out or token revocation, so nothing in Phase 0 or Phase 1 reads a session record (§6.4). **Correction to this row's former rationale:** ARCHITECTURE §3.2 does not claim statelessness — it specifies a bearer JWT and nothing about session storage; the word "stateless" in that document (ADR-004) means horizontally scalable API *instances*, which a PostgreSQL-backed session table would not contradict, since the state would be in the shared database and not in an instance | High **for the MVP as scoped** — additive and confined to `iam`. The confidence is in the *scope*, not in the design: a Product Owner ruling that `FR-IAM-06` means server-side termination reverses it (§6.4) |
| M12 | **Attachments store an object-storage key, not the bytes** | Keeping binaries out of PostgreSQL protects backup/restore times and the SLA sweep's working set. The storage adapter itself is not designed here | Medium — the column is a key either way |
| M13 | **`csat_score` on the ticket instead of a `csat_survey` table** | The MVP explicitly limits CSAT to *basic capture* (PRD §14.3); a survey aggregate would be speculative | High — extractable later |

---

## 19. Verification status

**Nothing in this document has been executed.** There is no workspace, no `data-source.ts`, no migration, no database. The concrete next steps, in order:

1. Scaffold the Nx workspace and the `libs/<context>/infrastructure` libraries (ARCHITECTURE §5.5).
2. Write the TypeORM persistence entities and mappers for `iam`, `audit` and `incident` first (phase 0 → phase 1 order).
3. Confirm the identifier default resolves on the target server (`SELECT uuidv7();`) before generating any migration — the schema carries a PostgreSQL ≥ 18 floor (§3.1.1, ADR-012).
4. `pnpm typeorm migration:generate -d apps/api/src/data-source.ts src/migrations/CreateFoundationTables`, review the generated SQL by hand — generated migrations are a draft, not an authority. TypeORM emits the column default it is given; the `uuidv7()` default is asserted in the review, not assumed.
5. Verify the check constraints, partial indexes, partitions and `GRANT`/`REVOKE` statements that TypeORM does **not** generate; they are written as explicit migration steps.
6. Prove NFR-PRF-02 and NFR-PRF-04 with `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` against a seeded volume before claiming either.

---

## 20. Entity dictionary — attribute-level reference

One block per persisted table, grouped by bounded context and ordered as in sections 6–15. For every table: what it is, every column with its PostgreSQL type, nullability, key role and default, the full constraint catalogue (`uq_*`, `ck_*`, FK delete behaviour) and every relationship with its cardinality and its kind — **hard FK** inside a context, **soft reference** across a context boundary (section 4). Enum value sets are listed where the type is first introduced.

> This dictionary is normative for the first TypeORM migrations and is subject to the same reading notice as the rest of the document: **nothing here has been executed against a live PostgreSQL 18 instance.**

### 20.1 `identity-access` — schema `iam`

#### `iam_user`

Aggregate root of the `User` aggregate and the phase-0 anchor of the whole model: it holds authentication material, the entitlement tier that drives catalog eligibility, and the PII columns that GDPR pseudonymization rewrites. Serves FR-IAM-01/02, FR-IAM-03 and NFR-SEC-07.

| Attribute | Type | Null | Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | NOT NULL | PK | `uuidv7()` | UUID v7 issued by the repository port; the DB default is a migration/fixture safety net only (§3.1). |
| `external_subject_id` | `varchar(64)` | NULL | UK (partial) | — | SSO/OIDC subject once FR-IAM-04 is delivered; null in the MVP local-credential mode. |
| `email` | `citext` | NOT NULL | UK | — | Login identity and notification address; case-insensitive by column type (FR-IAM-01). PII, rewritten on erasure. |
| `password_hash` | `varchar(255)` | NULL | — | — | bcrypt hash; null when the account is federated. Excluded at the mapper, never reachable from the API layer (NFR-SEC-01). |
| `display_name` | `varchar(150)` | NOT NULL | — | — | Name shown on tickets and activity history. PII, rewritten on erasure (NFR-SEC-07). |
| `phone` | `varchar(32)` | NULL | — | — | Optional contact for phone-logged intake (FR-OMN-02). PII, rewritten on erasure. |
| `locale` | `varchar(10)` | NOT NULL | — | `'en'` | Drives `Accept-Language` defaults and notification language (NFR-I18N-02/04). Default chosen per §3 conventions; DATA-MODEL.md does not state one. |
| `time_zone` | `varchar(64)` | NOT NULL | — | `'UTC'` | IANA zone, presentation only — SLA arithmetic never uses it (NFR-I18N-03). Default inferred from §3.3 (all instants are UTC). |
| `entitlement_tier` | `entitlement_tier_enum` | NOT NULL | — | — | Requester tier driving catalog eligibility (FR-SRQ-02, FR-CAT-04). |
| `status` | `user_status_enum` | NOT NULL | — | `'active'` | Lifecycle state; deactivation is `disabled`, never a row delete (§3.6, FR-IAM-05). |
| `last_login_at` | `timestamptz` | NULL | — | — | Adoption metric input (PRD §9.3). |
| `pseudonymized_at` | `timestamptz` | NULL | — | — | Non-null means the PII columns hold tombstone values after a lawful erasure (NFR-SEC-07, K9). |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | NOT NULL | — | — | Creation instant, set by the application through `ClockPort` (ADR-009); never a DB default or trigger. |
| `updated_at` | `timestamptz` | NOT NULL | — | — | Refreshed on every write (§3.3). |
| `created_by` | `uuid` | NULL | soft → `iam.iam_user.id` | — | Administrator who provisioned the account. Nullable because bootstrap and migration-seeded accounts have no acting user; DATA-MODEL.md §3.3 is silent on this case. |
| `updated_by` | `uuid` | NULL | soft → `iam.iam_user.id` | — | Last actor to modify the account (§3.3). |

**Constraints.**

| `ix_iam_user_status` | INDEX (partial) | `(id) WHERE status = 'active'` |
| — | FK | None. `created_by` / `updated_by` are soft references per §3.3, even inside the same schema. |

**Enum `entitlement_tier_enum`:** `player`, `team_manager`, `organizer`, `official`, `league_admin`, `staff`.
**Enum `user_status_enum`:** `active`, `suspended`, `disabled`.

#### `iam_role`

Administratively configurable lookup table (§3.5) and aggregate root of the `Role` aggregate: a named bundle of permissions granted to users. Serves FR-IAM-02 (RBAC, least privilege) and NFR-CFG-01 (roles configurable without a release).

#### `iam_permission`

Lookup table of atomic, code-named capabilities that the authorization guard checks; part of the `Role` aggregate's reference data. Serves FR-IAM-02 (least privilege) and FR-IAM-06 (re-authentication for privileged actions).

#### `iam_role_permission`

Pure join table between `iam_role` and `iam_permission` — the pair *is* the identity, so the PK is composite (§3.1). Append-only from the row's own point of view: a grant is inserted or deleted, never edited. Serves FR-IAM-02.

#### `iam_user_role`

Temporal role-grant record and part of the `User` aggregate: revocation sets `revoked_at` rather than deleting the row, so "who could do what on 3 May" stays answerable. Serves FR-IAM-05 and FR-AUD-05.

| Attribute | Type | Null | Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | NOT NULL | PK | `uuidv7()` | UUID v7 from the repository port; a surrogate key, because the `(user_id, role_id)` pair repeats over time. |

#### `iam_competition_scope`

Append-only grant record, part of the `User` aggregate: it turns "an Organizer sees tickets affecting **their** competitions" into a server-side predicate rather than a UI filter. Holds opaque SCMS identifiers with a free-text label fallback — no FK, no import, no calendar (§6.3). Serves FR-IAM-03 and FR-KNW-09.

| Attribute | Type | Null | Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | NOT NULL | PK | `uuidv7()` | UUID v7 from the repository port. |
| `user_id` | `uuid` | NOT NULL | FK → `iam.iam_user.id` | — | The user whose visibility is being broadened (FR-IAM-03). |
| `subject_type` | `competition_subject_enum` | NOT NULL | — | — | Kind of competition entity the scope covers. Schema-local enum: `iam.competition_subject_enum` is narrower than `incident.competition_subject_enum` by design. |
| `subject_external_id` | `varchar(100)` | NULL | — | — | Opaque SCMS identifier. **No FK into SCMS, ever** — SCMS is a separate system behind an anti-corruption layer (PRD D2). |
| `subject_label` | `varchar(255)` | NULL | — | — | Free-text fallback when the SCMS lookup is unavailable (R10, NFR-AVL-03). |
| `scope_kind` | `scope_kind_enum` | NOT NULL | — | — | The relationship that justifies the broadened visibility. |
| `valid_from` | `timestamptz` | NOT NULL | — | — | Start of the grant's validity window; grants are temporal, like role grants. |
| `valid_to` | `timestamptz` | NULL | — | — | Null while the grant is open-ended; setting it retires the grant without deleting it (§3.6). |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | NOT NULL | — | — | When the grant was recorded, via `ClockPort`. |
| `created_by` | `uuid` | NULL | soft → `iam.iam_user.id` | — | Administrator who issued the grant; null for seeded grants. No `updated_at` / `updated_by`: the row is append-only — retiring a scope sets `valid_to`, superseding it inserts a new row (§3.3, §6.3). |

|---|---|---|
| `pk_iam_competition_scope` | PK | `(id)` |
| `fk_iam_competition_scope_user_id` | FK | → `iam.iam_user.id` `ON DELETE RESTRICT` — users are never hard-deleted (§3.6) |
| `ck_iam_competition_scope_subject` | CHECK | `subject_external_id IS NOT NULL OR subject_label IS NOT NULL` — mirrors `ck_incident_subject` (§8.1) |
| `ck_iam_competition_scope_validity` | CHECK | `valid_to IS NULL OR valid_to > valid_from` — structural safety net; DATA-MODEL.md §6.3 does not state it |
| `uq_iam_competition_scope_active` | UNIQUE (partial) | `UNIQUE (user_id, subject_type, scope_kind, COALESCE(subject_external_id, subject_label)) WHERE valid_to IS NULL` — at most one **live** grant per user, subject and justification, while every retired row is preserved. The `WHERE` is what lets uniqueness and the append-only rule coexist (retire by setting `valid_to`, supersede by inserting a new row), exactly as `uq_iam_user_role_active` does for role grants (§6.2); declared absolute it would make retire-and-reissue impossible. `scope_kind` **is** in the key because each justification is granted and revoked independently — ceasing to own a tournament while remaining its approver is an ordinary transition, and a key without `scope_kind` would reject that legitimate state. The subject term is the `COALESCE`, not the raw column pair: `subject_external_id` is nullable — `ck_iam_competition_scope_subject` guarantees only that *one* of the two is present — so keying on the column alone would make every label-only grant distinct under PostgreSQL's `NULLS DISTINCT` default and let a revoked grant survive as an unnoticed live twin (FR-IAM-03, NFR-SEC-02). |
| `ix_iam_competition_scope_user` | INDEX (partial) | `(user_id, subject_type, subject_external_id) WHERE valid_to IS NULL` — evaluated on every scoped list query (FR-IAM-03, NFR-SEC-02). Its leading columns overlap `uq_iam_competition_scope_active`; both are declared deliberately — the unique index is the correctness constraint, this one is the declared read shape — and whether the read index survives is an `EXPLAIN` question at scaffolding time (§16), not a paper one. |

#### `catalog_form_definition`

Append-only, versioned child of the `ServiceOffering` aggregate: each row is one immutable version of an offering's request form. Editing a form publishes a **new** version; in-flight requests keep rendering and validating against the version they were created under. Serves FR-CAT-02, FR-SRQ-03 and NFR-CFG-02.

#### `catalog_form_field`

Append-only child of an immutable `catalog_form_definition`: one declarative field of a request form, addressed by a stable `field_key` that is copied onto each answer row. Serves FR-CAT-02, FR-SRQ-03 and NFR-I18N-01.

| Attribute | Type | Null | Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

#### `catalog_eligibility_rule`

Ordered, evaluable child of the `ServiceOffering` aggregate: an allow/deny rule that decides whether a given requester may see and request an offering. Serves FR-SRQ-02 and FR-CAT-04.

| Attribute | Type | Null | Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| `subject` | `eligibility_subject_enum` | NOT NULL | — | — | What the rule tests about the requester (FR-SRQ-02). |
| `operand` | `varchar(100)` | NOT NULL | — | — | The value compared: an `iam_role.code`, an `entitlement_tier_enum` value, or a `scope_kind_enum` value, depending on `subject`. Stored as text because the target lives in another context (ADR-003). |
| `effect` | `rule_effect_enum` | NOT NULL | — | `'allow'` | Outcome when the rule matches; `deny` wins by evaluation order. |
| `evaluation_order` | `integer` | NOT NULL | — | `0` | Deterministic evaluation sequence — an implicit order encoded only in code would be untestable at the data level (cf. M7). |
| `active` | `boolean` | NOT NULL | — | `true` | Retirement is a flag, never a delete (§3.6). |

**Enum `field_type_enum`** (introduced by `catalog_form_field`): `text`, `textarea`, `number`, `date`, `select`, `multiselect`, `boolean`, `user`, `competition_subject`, `attachment`.

#### `catalog_category`

Self-referencing lookup table and aggregate root of the `Category` taxonomy (Category → Subcategory → Item), shared by both ticket types and by catalog browsing. Placed here by modelling decision **M3** because `service-catalog` owns service reference data; ticket contexts hold `category_id` as a **soft** reference. Serves FR-INC-03, FR-CAT-01/05, NFR-CFG-01 and NFR-DAT-03.

| Attribute | Type | Null | Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

#### `catalog_category_translation`

Localization child of the `Category` aggregate: one row per category and locale, so a taxonomy node can be renamed per language without changing its stable identifier or rewriting history. Serves NFR-I18N-05 and NFR-DAT-03 ("one rename, zero historical facts changed").

### 20.3 `incident` — schema `incident`

#### `incident_ticket`

Aggregate root of the `Incident` aggregate (ADR-005): one row per Incident, carrying the inlined `TicketReference`, `Priority`, `CompetitionImpactFlag`, `CompetitionSubject`, `OriginChannel` and `ResolverAssignment` value objects as flat columns (§2). It is the persistence of FR-INC-01 → FR-INC-13 and FR-INC-18, and the only table in the context that carries `version` for optimistic locking.

| Attribute | Type | Null | Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | NOT NULL | PK | `uuidv7()` | UUID v7 issued by `IncidentRepositoryPort.nextIdentity()`; the DB default is a migration/fixture safety net only (§3.1) |

| `urgency` | `urgency_enum` | NOT NULL | — | — | Agent-assessed Urgency (FR-INC-04) |
| `priority` | `priority_enum` | NOT NULL | — | — | Derived from `(assessed_impact, urgency)` through the matrix; never chosen by a requester (FR-INC-04, R8) |

#### `incident_work_note`

Append-only part of the `Incident` aggregate holding the two distinct entry types required by FR-INC-11: public comments visible to the requester and internal work notes visible to agents only. The `visibility` column is what makes NFR-SEC-04 expressible as a server-side `WHERE`.

Append-only projection of the aggregate's lifecycle (M5): one row per state change, giving reporting a first-class, indexable in-context source for per-state durations (MTTA/MTTR net of pauses) without querying the partitioned cross-context journal. The absence of `updated_at` is the immutability statement (§3.3).

#### `incident_major_communication`

Append-only part of the `Incident` aggregate holding every stakeholder communication issued during a Major Incident, which is what makes the configurable communication cadence auditable (FR-MIM-02, FR-MIM-04, FR-NOT-04).

#### `incident_resolution_code`

Administratively configurable lookup (§3.5) of the resolution codes an agent must supply to resolve an Incident (FR-INC-07). Labels are not stored here — they live in `incident_resolution_code_translation` so a rename never rewrites history (NFR-DAT-03, NFR-I18N-05).

#### `incident_workflow`

Configuration-as-data root of the Incident lifecycle (FR-WFL-01, NFR-CFG-01). Workflows are **versioned, never edited in place**: publishing a new lifecycle inserts a new row with a new `version_no` while in-flight tickets keep pointing at the version they were created under (NFR-CFG-02, §8.4).

| Attribute | Type | Null | Key | Default | Description |

| `incident_ticket` | 1:N | hard FK (RESTRICT) | The lifecycle version governing a ticket |

#### `incident_workflow_state`

Configurable lifecycle state of an Incident workflow version — the lookup that `incident_ticket.state_id` points at instead of an enum, because FR-WFL-01 requires the lifecycle to change without code. `sla_clock` is what makes clock-stopping `Pending` states data rather than a hard-coded list (FR-INC-08).

#### `incident_workflow_transition`

Configuration-as-data edge of the lifecycle graph: which state pairs are legal, who may perform the move and under which declarative preconditions (FR-INC-06, FR-WFL-01). A transition absent from this table is impossible, which is how "configurable allowed transitions" is enforced without code.

#### `sr_state_transition`

Append-only history: one row per lifecycle move of a Service Request, a projection of the aggregate's lifecycle kept in-context so per-state durations are a first-class indexable read (M5). **No `updated_at` / `updated_by` — the absence of the columns is the immutability statement** (§3.3).

#### `sr_workflow`

Configuration-as-data: an immutable, versioned Service Request lifecycle definition. Publishing a new lifecycle inserts a new row with a new `version_no`; in-flight requests keep pointing at the version they were created under (FR-WFL-01, NFR-CFG-01/02).

#### `sr_workflow_state`

Configuration-as-data lookup: a single state of a `sr_workflow` version, carrying both its non-configurable category and its SLA clock semantics (FR-WFL-01, FR-SLA-08).

#### `sr_workflow_transition`

Configuration-as-data: an allowed move between two states of one `sr_workflow` version, with the permission required to perform it (FR-WFL-01, NFR-SEC-02).

### 20.5 `sla` — schema `sla`

#### `sla_support_schedule`

Configuration-as-data lookup and aggregate root of the support-schedule aggregate: the business-hours or 24×7 calendar against which SLA timers run (FR-SLA-03). It owns its windows and holidays and declares the IANA `time_zone` those wall-clock values are interpreted in.

| Attribute | Type | Null | Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | NOT NULL | PK | `uuidv7()` | Surrogate identity of the schedule |
| `code` | `varchar(64)` | NOT NULL | UK | — | Stable identifier used by seeds, policies and `iam.iam_resolver_group.coverage_schedule_id` (NFR-I18N-05) |
| `name` | `varchar(150)` | NOT NULL | — | — | Administrative label shown in the SLA configuration UI |

| `active` | `boolean` | NOT NULL | — | `true` | Retired schedules stay joinable by historical policies; nothing is deleted (§3.6) |

| `iam.iam_resolver_group` | 1:N | soft reference (cross-context, ADR-003) | Group coverage schedule, referenced from `iam` without a FK |

#### `sla_schedule_window`

Part of the support-schedule aggregate: one weekly opening window. `start_time` / `end_time` are **wall-clock `time` values interpreted in the parent schedule's `time_zone`**, not UTC instants — the deliberate exception to the "everything is `timestamptz` in UTC" rule (§3.3). The pair persists the inlined **`OpeningWindow`** value object of the `sla` domain — together with `day_of_week`, which `uq_sla_schedule_window` shows is part of the same value. It is explicitly **not** the shared kernel's `DateTimeRange` (§2, ARCHITECTURE §4.2): that primitive is an interval of UTC *instants*, and no instant pair can express "09:00–17:00 every Tuesday in `Europe/Madrid`" without inventing a date.

Part of the support-schedule aggregate: a non-working date excluded from SLA elapsed time. `holiday_date` is a **wall-clock `date` interpreted in the parent schedule's `time_zone`**, for the same reason as the windows (§3.3, FR-SLA-03). Like them it is an `sla`-owned value object (`HolidayDate`), never a kernel instant type (§2).

#### `sla_policy`

Aggregate root of the SLA-policy aggregate and configuration-as-data: a versioned commitment defining response and resolution/fulfillment targets for a record type, service, offering and priority (FR-SLA-01). `specificity` makes "attach exactly one applicable policy" (FR-SLA-02) a deterministic `ORDER BY`, not an implicit rule (M7).

#### `sla_instance`

Aggregate root of the `SlaInstance` aggregate: one live or historical timing commitment for one target of one ticket. It is the **canonical polymorphic soft reference** in the model — `record_type` + `record_id` address a ticket of some type with **no foreign key**, because `sla` must not depend on `incident` or `service-request` (ADR-003, §4.1). Remaining time is derivable from stored timestamps alone, so timers survive restarts (NFR-AVL-05, ADR-009).

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | NOT NULL | PK | `uuidv7()` | Surrogate identity of the commitment |

#### `kb_article_tag`

Pure join table resolving the N:M between articles and tags; the pair *is* the identity, so it carries a composite primary key and no surrogate key (§3.1). Serves tag-based retrieval (FR-KNW-04).

#### `kb_article_link`

Append-only record attaching an article to a record of another context — the row that makes knowledge-assisted resolution measurable (FR-KNW-05). `(record_type, record_id)` is a **polymorphic soft reference**: the target is an Incident, Service Request or Problem held as an opaque `uuid` with no foreign key, because `knowledge` may not depend on those contexts (§4.1, ADR-003).

#### `kb_article_feedback`

Part of the `kb_article` aggregate: one usefulness rating per reader per article, the source of the denormalized `helpful_count` / `not_helpful_count` counters and of the low-rated review queue (FR-KNW-07).

#### `kb_view_event`

Append-only immutable telemetry record of one article read, correlated by `session_id` so that self-service deflection — a view followed by no ticket within a configurable window — is measurable (FR-KNW-06). No `updated_at`, no `updated_by`.

| Attribute | Type | Null | Key | Default | Description |

#### `apr_workflow`

Aggregate root of the approval configuration: a versioned, named workflow bound to a record type, serving Service Requests now and Changes/Releases in phase 2 (FR-APR-01). Configuration-as-data — a new version is inserted, never edited in place (NFR-CFG-01/02).

#### `apr_request`

Aggregate root of one authorization in flight: raised against a record of another context and closed by a terminal state (FR-APR-01). `(record_type, record_id)` is a **polymorphic soft reference** — the subject is a Service Request today and a Change or Release in phase 2, held as an opaque `uuid` with no foreign key, because `approval` must not depend on those contexts (§4.1, ADR-003).

#### `apr_task`

Part of the `apr_request` aggregate: one approver's outstanding obligation within a stage, resolved from `apr_approver_rule` at creation time and read constantly by the approver inbox (FR-APR-02, FR-APR-05).

**Enum `apr_task_state_enum`:** `pending`, `approved`, `rejected`, `delegated`, `expired`.

#### `apr_decision`

Append-only immutable authorization record: exactly one decision per approval task, forever (FR-APR-03, FR-APR-07). Immutability is **structural, not procedural** — the table has no `updated_at` and no `updated_by`, the `ApprovalRepositoryPort` exposes no update or delete method for decisions (capability absence, the same technique as `audit`), and the application database role is granted `INSERT, SELECT` only on `approval.apr_decision` with **no UPDATE and no DELETE grant**. A defect cannot silently rewrite an authorization record.

**Enum `approval_decision_enum`:** `approved`, `rejected`.

#### `apr_delegation`

Standing delegation of a user's approval authority for a bounded period, recording both the delegate and the original approver so that accountability survives the delegation (FR-APR-04, phase 2).

| Attribute | Type | Null | Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | NOT NULL | PK | `uuidv7()` | UUID v7 issued by the repository port |

| `valid_to` | `timestamptz` | NULL | — | — | End of the window; `NULL` means open-ended until revoked |
| `reason` | `varchar(255)` | NULL | — | — | Justification shown in the approval history (FR-AUD-01) |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | NOT NULL | — | — | Set by the application through `ClockPort` (§3.3) |
| `updated_at` | `timestamptz` | NOT NULL | — | — | Refreshed when the window is shortened or revoked; the row is never deleted (§3.6) |

**Constraints.**

**Relationships.**

| Related entity | Cardinality | Kind | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apr_task` | 1:N | soft reference (cross-context, ADR-003) | An active delegation populates `apr_task.delegate_user_id` at resolution time; there is no FK because the delegation is evaluated, not owned |
| `iam.iam_user` | N:1 | soft reference (cross-context, ADR-003) | Delegator and delegate |

### 20.8 `notification` — schema `notification`

Cross-cutting dispatch context (§13). Templates, rules and stakeholder lists are configuration-as-data; `ntf_dispatch` is the **outbox and evidence record** written after commit off the domain-event bus (ADR-008), so a failing gateway can never roll back a ticket (NFR-AVL-03). No table in this schema is a system of record for a ticket: the source record is always a polymorphic soft reference.

#### `ntf_template`

Lookup / configuration-as-data aggregate root for a renderable message, keyed by a stable `code` and versioned rather than edited in place (§3.5, NFR-CFG-01/02). Serves FR-NOT-05 (templates configurable per event type and localizable).

| Attribute | Type | Null | Key | Default | Description |

| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | NOT NULL | — | — | Set by the application through `ClockPort` (§3.3, ADR-009) |

#### `ntf_stakeholder_list`

Lookup aggregate root naming a distribution list addressed as a whole — the Major Incident stakeholder list is the MVP instance (FR-NOT-04).

| Attribute | Type | Null | Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | NOT NULL | PK | `uuidv7()` (safety net) | UUID v7 from the repository port |

#### `ntf_stakeholder_member`

Child of the `ntf_stakeholder_list` aggregate: one addressable recipient, either an internal user (by id) or an external address for stakeholders who are not Sport ITSM users (FR-NOT-04).

| Attribute | Type | Null | Key | Default | Description |

**Relationships.**

| Related entity | Cardinality | Kind | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|

| `iam.iam_user` | N:1 | soft reference (cross-context, ADR-003) | Internal stakeholder identity; no FK, `iam` is a separate bounded context |

#### `ntf_dispatch`

Append-oriented **outbox and evidence record**: one row per rendered notification, recorded against its source record (FR-NOT-08) and drained by the post-commit send loop (ADR-008, NFR-AVL-03). It is never a system of record for the record it describes — the source is a polymorphic soft reference `(record_type, record_id)` with **no FK anywhere**; the only hard FK on the table is `template_id`, which stays inside the `notification` schema.

| Attribute | Type | Null | Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | NOT NULL | PK | `uuidv7()` (safety net) | UUID v7 — time-ordered, preserving index locality on this high-insert table (§3.1) |

| `recipient_address` | `varchar(255)` | NULL | — | — | Address resolved **at send time**, kept as evidence of where it went |
| `locale` | `varchar(10)` | NOT NULL | — | — | Locale the body was rendered in, from the recipient's profile (NFR-I18N-04) |
| `record_type` | `record_type_enum` | NOT NULL | soft → polymorphic | — | Source record family; half of the polymorphic reference (FR-NOT-08) |
| `record_id` | `uuid` | NOT NULL | soft → polymorphic | — | Source record identifier. **No FK by design** — a relational FK cannot express a polymorphic target (§4.1) |
| `record_reference` | `varchar(20)` | NULL | — | — | Denormalized `INC…` / `SRQ…` so the dispatch history reads without a cross-context join |
| `rendered_subject` | `varchar(255)` | NOT NULL | — | — | Exact subject sent — re-rendering from a later template version would falsify the evidence (§13.1) |
| `rendered_body` | `text` | NOT NULL | — | — | Exact body sent. Never contains an internal work note when the recipient is a requester (NFR-SEC-04) and never a credential or token (NFR-SEC-05) |
| `state` | `dispatch_state_enum` | NOT NULL | — | `'queued'` | `queued → sent / failed`, plus `read` for in-app and `cancelled` (FR-NOT-06/08) |
| `attempt_count` | `smallint` | NOT NULL | — | `0` | Retry bookkeeping for the in-process dispatcher |

| `queued_at` | `timestamptz` | NOT NULL | — | — | Enqueue instant; the outbox index scans this (`ix_ntf_outbox`) |
| `sent_at` | `timestamptz` | NULL | — | — | Delivery instant recorded by the gateway adapter |
| `read_at` | `timestamptz` | NULL | — | — | In-app read receipt (FR-NOT-06) |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | NOT NULL | — | — | §3.3, from `ClockPort` |
| `updated_at` | `timestamptz` | NOT NULL | — | — | Refreshed by state changes of the send loop only — content columns are never rewritten |
| `created_by` | `uuid` | NULL | soft → iam.iam_user.id | — | Null for system-generated dispatch, which is the normal case (`actor_type = 'system_rule'` in the matching audit entry) |
| `updated_by` | `uuid` | NULL | soft → iam.iam_user.id | — | Set only when an operator cancels a queued dispatch |

**Enum `dispatch_state_enum`:** `queued`, `sent`, `failed`, `read`, `cancelled`.

#### `ntf_preference`

Per-user opt-in/opt-out row for a non-mandatory `(event_type, channel)` pair (FR-NOT-07, COULD priority — phase 4). Absence of a row means the rule's default applies; a mandatory rule ignores this table entirely.

| Attribute | Type | Null | Key | Default | Description |

| `id` | `uuid` | NOT NULL | PK | `uuidv7()` (safety net) | UUID v7 from the repository port |

| Name | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `pk_ntf_preference` | PK | `(id)` |
| `uq_ntf_preference_scope` | UNIQUE | `(user_id, event_type, channel)` — one decision per user, event and channel |
| — | Policy note | No constraint can express "mandatory notifications cannot be disabled" across tables; that is a domain rule in the `notification` context, evaluated against `ntf_rule.is_mandatory` before a preference is consulted (FR-NOT-07) |

**Relationships.**

| Related entity | Cardinality | Kind | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `iam.iam_user` | N:1 | soft reference (cross-context, ADR-003) | The preference owner; no FK across schemas |
| `notification.ntf_rule` | N:1 | soft reference (cross-context, ADR-003) | Matched by `(event_type, channel)`, never by rule id, so retiring a rule cannot orphan a preference |

### 20.9 `audit` — schema `audit`

One table (§14). It is the append-only, RANGE-partitioned compliance journal for every record type in the system, and the only authority for "who changed what" (FR-AUD-01→06, NFR-AUD-01/02/03, constraint K4). It is deliberately dependency-free: it references records polymorphically and holds **no foreign key anywhere**, so it outlives any context and any record.

#### `audit_entry`

Append-only journal entry for one action on one record — a state transition, field change, assignment, comment, approval, notification or automated rule execution (FR-AUD-01). Administrative configuration changes use the same table with `record_type = 'configuration'` (FR-AUD-05). The **primary key is composite, `(id, occurred_at)`**, because the table is `PARTITION BY RANGE (occurred_at)` with one partition per month and PostgreSQL requires the partition key to participate in every unique constraint on a partitioned table (§14.3, M9).

| Attribute | Type | Null | Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | NOT NULL | PK (part 1 of 2) | `uuidv7()` (safety net) | UUID v7 — time-ordered, so inserts stay at the right edge of the index (§3.1) |
| `occurred_at` | `timestamptz` | NOT NULL | PK (part 2 of 2) | — | Instant of the action from `ClockPort` (ADR-009), **and** the monthly RANGE partition key. It replaces `created_at`: there is no separate creation column |
| `event_id` | `uuid` | NOT NULL | UK(event_id, occurred_at) | — | Domain-event identifier used as an **idempotency key** — a retried dispatch cannot double-write history (FR-AUD-01, NFR-AUD-02) |
| `context` | `varchar(32)` | NOT NULL | — | — | Bounded context that produced the entry (`incident`, `service_request`, `sla`, `approval`, `iam`, `catalog`, `knowledge`, `notification`) |

### 20.10 `reporting` — schema `reporting`

Projections only (§15). No table here is a system of record, none joins into another context's tables at will (ARCHITECTURE §4.3), and **none carries a foreign key of any kind** — every reference is a polymorphic or cross-context soft reference by id. All five tables are **rebuildable**: dropping and replaying them from domain events must produce identical numbers (FR-RPT-07), and their only integrity guarantee is `rpt_projection_run`, which records the watermark, row count, duration and outcome that a reported figure is attributable to. Consistently with §3.4, the enum types used below are declared in the `reporting` schema itself (`reporting.record_type_enum`, `reporting.priority_enum`, `reporting.state_category_enum`, `reporting.origin_channel_enum`, `reporting.competition_subject_enum`), mirroring the source values — a projection must not take a type dependency on another context.

None of these tables carries `created_by`, `updated_by` or `updated_at`: a projection row has no author and no edit history, only a rebuild watermark (`projected_at`). Nor do they carry `version`: they are not aggregate roots, so there is nothing to lock optimistically.

#### `rpt_ticket_fact`

Denormalized read model with **one row per ticket**, unioning Incidents and Service Requests so every management KPI in FR-RPT-02 is a single-table scan (M10). Its `id` is the source ticket's id, which makes a rebuild an idempotent upsert. Never a system of record: the ticket lives in `incident` / `service_request`.

| Attribute | Type | Null | Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | NOT NULL | PK, soft → polymorphic | — | **The same id as the source ticket** — the projection is a 1:1 mirror, so rebuilding is an idempotent upsert (§15.1). No FK: the source is polymorphic and cross-context |

| `reference` | `varchar(20)` | NOT NULL | UK | — | Denormalized `INC…` / `SRQ…` for export and drill-down (FR-RPT-06) |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | NOT NULL | — | — | **The source ticket's** creation instant, copied — the period axis of every report (FR-RPT-05). Not an audit column |
| `service_id` | `uuid` | NULL | soft → catalog.catalog_service.id | — | Service filter dimension (FR-RPT-05) |
| `category_id` | `uuid` | NULL | soft → catalog.catalog_category.id | — | Category filter dimension (FR-RPT-05) |
| `category_path` | `varchar(255)` | NULL | — | — | Denormalized label path frozen at projection time, so renaming a category cannot retroactively change a historical report (NFR-DAT-03) |
| `priority` | `priority_enum` | NOT NULL | — | — | Priority filter dimension, P1–P4 (FR-RPT-01/05) |
| `competition_affects` | `boolean` | NOT NULL | — | `false` | The flagged subset behind the domain KPIs (FR-RPT-04, ADR-006) |

Append-only run journal: one row per projection pass recording its watermark window, row count, duration and outcome. It is the **only integrity guarantee the `reporting` schema has** — because every other table here is a rebuildable projection with no foreign keys, a reported figure is trustworthy exactly insofar as it is attributable to a successful run (FR-RPT-07). It is also the home of the orphaned-soft-reference integrity metric described in §4.2.
